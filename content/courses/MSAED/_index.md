## Course Description

This course is restricted to students in the MS in Applied Economics program. The course  provides a basic introduction to modern data analysis methods. We will use R Studio and R Markdown to produce several projects that embed the R code for data collection, data analysis, generation and interpretation of results into a single, reproducible report in HTML and PDF formats that may be updated with a single file execution step. Our primary focus will be on short-term forecasts of economic variables. Topics include: data collection and formatting into a “tidy” data frame (an updated version of SQL); forecasting methods; forecast ensembles and averaging; time-series methods such as ARIMA, VAR and VECM; and nowcasting using large data sets with mixed frequencies, different beginning and ending dates, and missing data.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course you will:

1. be familiar with the essential techniques in economic  data analysis and forecasting;
2. know how to specify a model that is consistent with economic theory;
3. be able to choose an appropriate statistical method to estimate the model;
4. interpret your estimation and forecast results;
5. prepare a brief technical report using R Markdown that can be easily updated and understood by a non-specialist.
